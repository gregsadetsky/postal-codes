# postal-codes

## documentation / notes on how we did it

### initial call

sept 10, 2019

summary / outcome of call:
handwritten postcards sent by ("regular", "snail") mail
we use p5.js for our sketches
the first prompt is a question
the first postcard is an answer to that question + another question

questions are taken from existing questionnaires (medical, scifi) --- decision by greg..?

to decide who asked the first question:

Ariel picked tail
Greg picked head (the Queen)
person who loses asks the question
person who wins answers the question

random.org decided that Greg asks the 1st question

Greg got 24 hour to ask the first question
greg will get 1 week after getting the first postcard to reply

when getting the postcard
posting to instagram and tagging the other person

person getting a postcard submits code to (this) shared github repository 

### timeout

if a postcard is not received within 1 month, we consider it lost. the postcard's content is then sent digitally to the other party.

### card 1

Question 1, *How often do you feel that you have a lot in common with the people around you?*, was asked over email by Greg on September 11th, 2019. Ariel sent the first card on September 23rd 2019, answering the question.

Greg received Ariel's card on October 23rd 2019

Greg re-assembled the code on October 30th 2019

work will be ongoing in the `card1` directory

### card 2

Greg sent the card on January 13th 2020, answering the question *How do you feel about sharing deep worries with people?*

Greg sent backup of card by mail on January 20th 2020

Ariel received the card and backup together on February 21st 2020

Ariel re-assembled the code on February 22nd 2020

work will be ongoing in the `card2` directory

### rules change

we decided to change the amount of time to answer a card from 1 week to 1 month, starting with card #3, in order to acommodate more complex processes/answers

TODO when did this new rule come into effect? Somewhere after Feb 22nd 2020, but when?

### Corona-related change

Ariel and Greg agreed on March 22nd 2020 to stop sending cards by mail considering everything. They will instead send each other a sketch throughout the week, working on it a few minutes per day, one of them working on the sketch on Monday, the other working on Tuesday, etc. on one common topic

On March 23rd, Ariel and Greg agreed this new project would be called Invocations and the first topic would be Hope. The code for this [lives here](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/invocations).
